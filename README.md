# Email spam detection with machine learning

Email spam detection with machine learning is the process of identifying unsolicited and unwanted email messages, known as spam, using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques.

The goal of email spam detection is to automatically classify incoming emails as either spam or not spam, also known as ham. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails to recognize patterns and characteristics that are indicative of spam, such as certain keywords, phrases, or sender addresses.

Email spam detection with machine learning is important for email providers and users as it helps to reduce the number of unwanted emails in the inbox and improves the overall user experience.
